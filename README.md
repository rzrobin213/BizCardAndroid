# BizCard-Android

This is the Android port of a flask app developed for the Spring 2019 CUAppDev Backend Course Hack Challenge. I created this app primarily for the purpose of learning the basics of android development and as a productive summer project. The app was developed using Android Studio in Java. Some of the libraries and tools used were the Volley HTTP library, Picasso image loading and caching library, Gson Java library, and a recyclerview widget.
